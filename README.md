I created a  landing page which is an ideal web development project for beginners. It contains basic
knowledge of HTML and CSS. Through this project, I learn to create columns, divide
sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. The most important aspect is
unleashing  creativity to design an impressive page. Paying attention to alignments,
padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. Being mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping
elements. In short, a landing page project allows  to apply HTML and CSS skills,
encouraging  creativity while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
